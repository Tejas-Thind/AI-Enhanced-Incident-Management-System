# Incident Suggestions Assistant

This project simulates a real-time incident replay system where each message from a transcript is analyzed by an AI assistant (via OpenAI) to extract actionable suggestions.

## ðŸš€ How to Start the Server

### 1. Backend (Rails)

```bash
cd rails_api  
bundle install  
rails server
```

Youâ€™ll also need to add your OpenAI key in a `.env` file at the root of your Rails app `rails_api/`:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here


Make sure you have `dotenv-rails` in your Gemfile.

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```


This assumes the Rails server is running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can configure CORS in `config/initializers/cors.rb` if needed.

## How to Simulate the Replay

- Ensure the backend server is running.
- Start the frontend.
- Use the UI to play, pause, and restart the replay.
- Watch messages appear on the left and suggestions update dynamically on the right.
- The backend uses OpenAI to analyze the message for:
  - Action Items
  - Root Cause Signals
  - Metadata Hints
  - Timeline Events
  - Follow-up Tasks (tasks to be done after the incident)

## Decisions Made

- **In-memory Session Caching:** Chose to keep chat context in memory per user instead of a database to improve speed and simplify architecture.
- **No Database for Suggestions:** Disabled persistent storage for suggestions to focus on real-time processing and reduce complexity for the scope of this assignment.
- **Categorized Suggestions:** Implemented six detailed categories to help users filter and focus on relevant incident information.
- **Separate Frontend and Backend:** Used Rails API backend and React frontend (Vite/Next.js) for modularity and scalability.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:** Selected for its balance of speed and response quality in generating incident suggestions.

---

## Future Improvements (If I Had More Time)

- **User-Uploaded JSON Transcripts:** Allow users to upload their own transcript files and manage multiple transcript sessions separately.
- **Database Integration:** Incorporate PostgreSQL to persist messages, suggestions, and user sessions for better data management and historical analysis.
- **Incident AI Chatbot:** Enable an interactive chatbot feature so users can ask questions and receive AI insights based on the full incident context.
- **Timeline Visualization:** Develop a visual timeline component showing key incident events, helping users quickly understand the incident flow and important milestones.

## Time Spent

I spent approximately 8 hours developing this project, focusing on building a robust backend API and a responsive, categorized frontend interface to simulate incident replays effectively.
